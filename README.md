# Vite/React + Tailwind CSS v4 demo

Plain installation of Vite and Tailwind CSS v4.

## Install

After cloning the repository, run:

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

## Setup

The Tailwind CSS configuration mimics a custom setup with a custom theme. It disables the preflight styles and default theme and references a custom theme in its place.

## Why?

I was trying to debug a styling issue with Tailwind and needed a simple, noncomplex starting point. [The problem was me](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/discussions/15761).
